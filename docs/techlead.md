# Delivery Team Technical Leadership

## Managing Up

### Tech Lead Pairing 

Pairing is a good thing - and not just when writing code. Typically any team will need more attention than one person can provide, and will always have someone ambitious enough to want to do more (if not, this is an issue and should be flagged early!)

Find your co-lead, and decide what responsibilities you can own and what you need to share together. 

Typically the best division of labour is inwards and outwards facing. The more senior co-lead will be better placed to the big picture and stakeholder management stuff (delivery road map, technical vision, value ownership, kickoffs and sign-offs). 

On the other hand, someone coming up from being a senior developer will have a better hold of the tech and quality concepts (e.g. pushing the team to better quality practices, maintaining and improving pipelines, providing support to the other developers in the team).

I've heard multiple ways of describing this: Mummy & Daddy (a bit heteronormative), Yin & Yang (similarly has some gender associations), Lead & Anchor (more formal), Bella & Bertie (shout out to any Liverpudlians that get the reference). 

The idea is simple: watching each other's back, so that we don't get blind-sided. While certain areas are _championed_ by one or the other they shouldn't become siloed! One of the big benefits of this approach is avoiding any bus factors if someone is ill, on leave, suddenly leaves the team or just gets swamped and needs backup. 

### Leads Sync Time 

Regular, likely daily but not mandatory. Anyone responsible for stakeholder management and strategic decision making should be talking regularly. At first these sessions will take a long time, but as you get more familiar the group will get better at communicating. Book in a lot of time for it initially. 

Early on everyone will probably want to attend, but as schedules get busy and other things take priority on certain days - the same crowd doesn't (and probably shouldn't) show up every day.

The attendees will vary by account, but [co-leads](#tech-lead-pairing), engineering or delivery managers and product owners are obvious candidates.

Use this meeting to vent, update and raise flags. One of the big issues you'll have is feeling overwhelmed or blindsided. If that happens, this group should know and do something about it. 

> :warning: Problems that get raised but ignored or downplayed are a smell, because anyone in this group should be competent enough to know when they're at their limit...

### Keep Something Back For The Big Picture

I can be tempting for me to throw myself into a project and try to do everything myself. Either I see lots of things that I _want_ to do and see as valuable, and so agree to them; or I don't currently trust the team to get on with it themselves (and I don't trust my powers of [delegation](#delegate-early--aggressively) yet and suddenly _too much_ deserves my special attention). This is bad, as it means you get stuck in a closed 'keeping the lights on' mindset and can't take a step back without feeling like you've failed.

So, in the first place, it's important to preserve space in your own time to stop, reflect and see the big picture. There's probably something easier that you can be doing once you take a moment to look, but you never will if you're too busy...

Secondly, sometimes things do just ramp up fast: no-one can expect their workload to stay the same week in/week out. If you find yourself having a very busy week, then raise it in your [lead sync ups](#leads-sync-time). If it _keeps_ happening for several weeks - you've probably got too much, and aren't actually doing _your_ job anymore. Something (or some things) needs to be delegated and soon, else you'll drop a ball you didn't mean to.

This is the point where it's vital to shout out to the rest of the leadership as a priority - _find_ the time to do it, no matter how busy or stressful. It _has_ to be done and won't get any easier if you wait. Ask for:

1. Help dealing with your current workload
2. Time to walk through what you're doing together
3. Opinions on what can be delegated (or dropped gracefully)
4. Support in getting those things off of your plate (as changing pace takes time too)

If they're too busy to help, then you've got a bigger problem than you thought and it's time to bring in the big guns. Escalate _hard_ to whoever you think is best, and get ready to switch into safety mode.

## Building A High Performing Team
### Regular 1-1s with Individual Members

Set up regular time with everyone up front - dedicate a slot in your day to it and rotate through people as often as you can (once a week is ideal). Talk with everyone regularly about how they are, what's annoying them, what you can be doing to help, what opportunities they would like (and how they would like to grow) and how they're progressing with those things that you've [delegated to them](#delegate-early--aggressively).

### Delegate Early & Aggressively

You won't have enough time, so get a plan together early or what needs doing and what the team's capabilities are. Set a strong vision and _write down_ what your expectations are for each person. In your [regular catchups](#regular-1-1s-with-individual-members) make sure that you refer back to the same expectations and walk through what results have been against expectations. 

### Capture all work in the same place

Encourage team members to capture items on your team board and talk about it - don't let them skip it in standup, and encourage work be _done_ the same way that we would any normal work in dev. 

A tech lead has lots of these tasks, and it helps if everyone can see what you're doing. Your biggest challenge is probably keeping track of them and making sure everything is on there - if you can [find a buddy](#tech-lead-pairing) to give you some accountability, then all the better. 

### Prioritise Coaching & Teaching

Accelerating your team and getting them doing more is the way to get more done - a 10x doesn't add more work, they multiply other's work. Make sure that your team has a good understanding over any part of the system, in particular the parts that will be changing or being used soon (by you or customers).

As a more experienced developer, you will naturally pick up more knowledge and understanding. While valuable, it's easy to also become a bottleneck or the only one that actually understands as you continue to maintain or fix issues. You need to be constantly shedding that responsibility off to the rest of the team.

Run a regular [blind spots session](./sessions.md#blind-spots) and make sure you're asking everyone in your [1-1 catchups](#regular-1-1s-with-individual-members) if they have any areas they're uncomfortable or worried about. Keep the team organising knowledge shares and deep dives of the system, and dedicate time each week for the team to cover a topic (even if it's just a refresher). 

If it really feels like the team understands the whole of the current system (and well done on that), then don't be afraid to do more knowledge sharing about other parts of the system or what you may be using in the future. Don't get complacent though - you'll be surprised at how quickly that understanding atrophies. 

N.B. - you shouldn't be the only one doing this. Use this as an opportunity to [delegate](#delegate-early--aggressively) and get other team members to also share their knowledge and understanding. They'll be constantly learning and picking up new things too on their own work - this can be a good opportunity to code share and review of completed work.
